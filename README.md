# Yii Boilerplate

## Why ?

Everytime I start a new project, I did the same installation steps over and
over again. So I had he idea of this "master" project 

## How to install it?

That's simple: 

- git clone git@github.com:mintao-gmbh-und-co-kg/Yii-Boilerplate.git <PROJECT-NAME>
- where <PROJECT-NAME> is a name you want to call your new yii project
- cd <PROJECT-NAME>
- git submodule init
- git submodule update
- This will cause git to download all dependend submodules
